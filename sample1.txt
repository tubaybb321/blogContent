# Initial experiment with Pelican blogging system


I started by installing Pelican and Markdown, since I intended to write my Pelican content in Markdown:

    ::::Text only
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects$ pip install Pelican
    Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): Pelican in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    Cleaning up...
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects$ pip install Markdown
    Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): Markdown in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    Cleaning up...

(OK - they were already installed before I wrote this entry, but such is life)

Next, I created the directory where the blog content and blog
support/creation files would live 

    ::::Text only
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects$ mkdir test1
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects$ cd ./test1

The creation of the blog was then handled by running the
*pelican-quickstart* command. This created the directory structure in
which the blog would live and asked a series of questions that helped
create the configuration files (pelicanconf.py & publishconf.py) and
files to help speed standard tasks for creating blog entries and
publishing them (Makefile & fabfile.py - I will be using Makefile). It
will also create a directory for content and one 

    ::::Text only
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects/test2$ pelican-quickstart
    Welcome to pelican-quickstart v3.5.0.

    This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

    Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
    needed by Pelican.

    
    > Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] ./
    > What will be the title of this web site? Notes To Self
    > Who will be the author of this web site? Moonshine Mulligan
    > What will be the default language of this web site? [en] 
    > Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., http://example.com   (Y/n) Y
    > What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash)  http://tubaybb321.github.io
    > Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) 
    > How many articles per page do you want? [10] 
    > Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) 
    > Do you want an auto-reload & simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? (Y/n) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) 
    > Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) y
    > Is this your personal page (username.github.io)? (y/N) y
    Done. Your new project is available at /home/me/Projects/PelicanProjects/test1

This process will create the following directory structure:

    
    ::::Text only
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects/test2$ ls ./content
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects/test2$ tree
    .
    ├── content
    ├── develop_server.sh
    ├── fabfile.py
    ├── Makefile
    ├── output
    ├── pelicanconf.py
    └── publishconf.py

    2 directories, 5 files

Now, I can test my blog on localhost to see a blank entry and convince
myself that the machinery of the blog is working, by using one of the
commands from the Makefile:

    
    ::::Text only
    me@Bedrock1:~/Projects/PelicanProjects/test2$ make serve
    cd /home/me/Projects/PelicanProjects/test2/output && python -m pelican.server
    127.0.0.1 - - [19/Dec/2014 22:03:34] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    WARNING:root:Unable to find file /favicon.ico/index.html or variations.
    WARNING:root:Unable to find file /favicon.ico/index.html or variations.
       C-c C-cmake: *** [serve] Interrupt

Next, I wanted to create a GitHub repository. Since this was not going
to be associated with a project, I decided to use a GitHub user page.


     ::::Text only
